    "Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as drug discovery data, global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. This tutorial will provide a general exposure on dimensionality reduction methods and give advice about the suitability of methods implementation onto drug discovery data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the area of drug discovery data analysis, it compromises with (i) omics, (ii) phsiochemical properties of compounds, (iii) in vitro/in vivo experimental results and (iv) paramters extracted from medical images.\n",
    "\n",
    "a well-known dimensionality reduction method called principal component analysis (PCA) is vastly used, but data scientists usually ignore the limitation and assumption of PCA. Imagine the useful information hidden in a bunch of data is stored in a safe, then currently there are no such methods that will be the key to all the safe. Thus, before trying to use the key such as PCA onto the safe, more efficient and pleasing way is to check the type of your safe (dataset), otherwise, the result of methods will normally be disappointing and meaningless. Similarly, it is better to check the step of your analysis procedure and the type of covariates in your data set before taking a close look at this tutorial. \n",

    "The introduction below includes classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS); nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods such as kernel PCA, which are capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations; another algorithm called isomap developed by [Tenenbaum and Langford (2000)](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/290/5500/2319), it computes a globally optimal solution for an important class of data manifolds.\n",

    "The methods covered above can be implemented by build-in toolbox developed by [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/unsupervised_learning.html) in the language of Python, while other useful methods such as self-organizing map (SOM) are not introduced here. For readers looking for results of evaluation of methods, a review paper was cited below.\n",
    "\n",
    "A comparison of nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods was made by [Venna and Kaski (2006)](), methods are evaluated by *trustworthiness* of visualisation and *discontinuity* of the mapping. They concluded that isomap and LLE are designed to extract manifolds, while stochastic neighbour embedding (SNE) and self-organizing map (SOM) are more generally targeted for dimensionality reduction. For the purpose of data visualization, SOM and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) were recommended; for purpose of original neighbourhoods preservation, linear PCA and SNE were recommended."
